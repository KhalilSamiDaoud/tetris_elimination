**Tetris Elemination, by Khalil S. Daoud**

Tetris Elimination is a multiplayer twist on tetris that allows up to 5 users to play tetris with each other in an elimination style match. The project consists of a server and a GUI with custom designed assets designed with C# and WPF. The server will be able to create multiple lobbies that can host matches independently of each other, and allows users to input commands by running both a lobby controller and command thread.

-Single Player Mode
-Sound Effects & Music
