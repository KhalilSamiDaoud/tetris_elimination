**Tetris Elemination, by Khalil S. Daoud**

Tetris Elimination is a multiplayer twist on tetris that allows up to 6 users to play tetris with each other in an elimination style match. The project consists of a server and a GUI with custom designed assets designed with C# and WPF. The server will be able to create multiple lobbies by creating up to 4 threads that can host matches independently of each other, and keep track of a server wide high score.

Verion 0.9B

This version includes the following features:

-Single Player Mode (Fully working, minor bugs)
-Sound Effects 
-Transition Effects

To compile this version, you will need to update the file paths for the audiofiles used in the game. This will be patched in a leter version so this is not nessesary, it is recommended that if you want to run this game you download and run the executable, which will be linked below. If you are using a smaller screen like a laptop, the whole application may not fit on your screen, as auto-scaling has not been implemented yet.
