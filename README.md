Tetris Elemination, by Khalil S. Daoud

Tetris Elimination is a multiplayer twist on tetris that allows up to 6 users to play tetris with each other in an elimination style match. The project consists of a server and a GUI with custom designed assets designed with C# and WPF. The server will be able to create multiple lobbies by creating up to 4 threads that can host matches independently of each other, and keep track of a server wide high score.

Verion 0.9B

This version includes the following features:

-Single Player Mode (Fully working, minor bugs)
-Sound Effects 
-Transition Effects

To compile this version, you will need to update the file paths for the audiofiles used in the game. This will be patched in a leter version so this is not nessesary, it is recommended that if you want to run this game you download and run the executable, which will be linked below.
